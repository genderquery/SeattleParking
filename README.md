**This project on indefinite hiatus.**

An Android implementation of [SDOT](http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/)'s [Seattle Parking Map](http://web6.seattle.gov/sdot/seattleparkingmap/). Overlays lines and markers on a Google Map and provides further details on the availability and regulations concerning street parking and parking facilties in the city of Seattle.

## TODO
* ~~Draw custom map because the one from the server is really ugly and doesn't rotate properly~~
* ~~Implement a TileProvider with caching to improve user experience and reduce network traffic~~
* Add a navigation drawer to select layers, access options, etc
* Add a bottom sheet for details
